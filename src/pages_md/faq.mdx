# How do I join SISC Coders?

Don't worry - you already have! SIGPwny is completely free and requires no registration. To get the full experience,
we reccommend joining our [discord](https://sigpwny.com/discord) and then [authenticating](https://sigpwny.com/auth) 
your account to gain access to club channels.

You can read more about what authenticating entails, and other opportunities to get involved below.

# When do Coders meet?

Generally, we meet biweekly on Thursdays from 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM. If there are changes, we'll inform you through Discord and mail.

# What do Coders do?

SISC Coders does a lot of different things, and there are plenty of ways to get involved!

Throughout the school year, SIGPwny runs educational cybersecurity meetings on a variety of topics, and
then plays [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf) together as a club against other universities. Alongside each
meeting, we run our own CTF throughout the semester, [Pwny CTF](https://ctf.sigpwny.com/), with prizes for top players.

SIGPwny also runs two major events:

+ [UIUCTF](https://sigpwny.com/events/uiuctf/2023/), a high-profile CTF event every summer
+ [Fall CTF](https://sigpwny.com/events/fallctf/2022/), aimed at UIUC students new to cybersecurity

During the spring semester, we participate or attend larger events that rotate depending on the club's interest.
In 2023, we attended [CypherCon](https://cyphercon.com/), and [eCTF](https://ectf.mitre.org/).


# What does club leadership look like at SISC Coders?

## Student Leaders

SIGPwny admin team is similar to executive board members in other clubs. The admins are responsible for organizing
events, handling logistics, managing club finances, and ultimately, keeping SIGPwny running. Unlike leadership
positions in other clubs, the admin team is very dynamic and fluid, with more members than a typical top-four 
council and no explicitly defined roles. Becoming an admin is an invite-only process and requires an extraordinary 
amount of dedication and trust from the existing admin team - only the most active helpers can become admins.

## Club Moderators

SIGPwny helpers are similar to committee officers in other clubs. We have chosen to use the term "helper" to 
emphasize that you can call on any one of us for help with your cybersecurity journey, whether that be developing
your technical skills, getting leadership experience, receiving career advice, and more. Helpers are responsible 
for improving the club experience, whether that be running meetings, leading projects, or assisting admins with 
current goals.

# What do I need to do to become a future Student Leader?

SISC Coders looks for the following characteristics:

- You are a Southville student in Grade 9-12
- You love coding
- You frequently attend meetings and are actively engaged with the meeting content
- You actively interact with other club members
- You are looking to give back to the club
- You have a learning/teaching-focused mindset
- You demonstrate an interest in improving the club. This can be shown in various ways, such as contributing to ongoing projects, sharing your cybersecurity knowledge by running a meeting / participating in CTFs, or expressing interest in \{design, branding, outreach, and marketing\}.

To show your interest, you may also ask a Student Leader to help run a meeting!
