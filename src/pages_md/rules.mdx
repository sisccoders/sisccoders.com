# Code of Conduct
Last updated: 2023-11-12

Welcome to the SISC Coders Club! We are committed to fostering a community where everyone can learn, share, and grow in an atmosphere of mutual respect and encouragement. To ensure a positive experience for all members, we ask that you adhere to the following rules in all our club-related interactions, including meetings, events, and online platforms.

1. **Be respectful**. Keep your messages civil and don't bully, troll, or harass others. Do not start needless arguments for the sake of arguing.
2. **Nothing illegal**. Do not perform, encourage, or discuss illegal activities. Do not doxx or reveal sensitive information belonging to others without their permission.
3. **No NSFW or suggestive content**. Nudity or gore is not allowed. If you have to ask, don't post it. Swearing is allowed as long as it follows all other rules.
4. **Don't spam**. Spam can include excessive messages, emojis, images, advertisements, and @mentions. If you want to promote something, ask a leader or moderator first.
5. **Use common sense**. The leaders have the final say on misconduct and punishments given. This rule is a "catch-all" rule.
